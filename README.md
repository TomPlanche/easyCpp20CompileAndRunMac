## Compile and run

### - Compile all files and run

```shell
yourAliasName
```

### - Compile, ignore file(s) and run

```shell
yourAliasName ignoredFile1.cpp ... ignoredFilesN.cpp
```



## Compile

### - You want to compile all of the .cpp files in your directory.

```shell
yourAliasName -c
```

### - You want to ignore files.

```shell
yourAliasName -c ignoredFile1.cpp ... ignoredFilesN.cpp
```

## Run

This senario is the complex one.

Thereâ€™s a lot of different cases.

## - The compiled file 'mainTqt' already exists.

```shell
yourAliasName -r
```

## - The compiled file 'mainTqt' does not exist.

```shell
yourAliasName -r
```

```shell
yourPath/mainTqt does not exist.
Do you want to compile and run ? (y/n) :
```

### - If you want to compile then run

```shell
Do you want to compile and run ? (y/n) : y
Do you not want to compile certain files ? (y/n) :
```

#### - If you want to ignore files:

```shell
Do you not want to compile certain files ? (y/n) : y
Name(s) of the file(s) that you want to ignore : ignoredFile1.cpp ignoredFile2.cpp

----- Compiling...
ignoredFile1.cpp ignored.
ignoredFile2.cpp ignored.
Compilation of othersFilesNames into mainTqt.
----- Compiling complete.
```

#### - If you don't  want to ignore files:

```shell
Do you not want to compile certain files ? (y/n) : n

----- Compiling...
Compilation of allCppFilesNames into mainTqt.
----- Compiling complete.
```
